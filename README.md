# Unhandled AsyncStorage Crash in Expo

This repository demonstrates a bug where AsyncStorage in an Expo app crashes without providing any error messages. The crash appears to be related to either the volume or complexity of the data stored.

## Problem

The app functions normally for some time before abruptly crashing without any helpful console output. Debugging is difficult due to the lack of specific error information.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing more robust error handling and potentially optimizing data storage to reduce the load on AsyncStorage. This may involve restructuring data, using a different storage method for large data, or implementing data limits and cleanup mechanisms.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on a device or simulator.
4.  Observe the app's behavior over time.  The crash may not occur immediately.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the need for more comprehensive error reporting within AsyncStorage and robust error handling in the application code.
